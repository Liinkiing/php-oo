# php-oo
A test made during my Canadian school for learning purposes in PHP

I wanted to test the Composer autoloading feature, and when developping the projet, I wanted to create a little system to easily access
a database. I've inspired myself a lot by how the [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony) framework works (like for exemple the presence of Repositories and Models)
